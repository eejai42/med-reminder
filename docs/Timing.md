### Timing Configurations

- **Minutes Per Day (1440):** This parameter represents the number of minutes in a standard day, aligning with the real-world time system. It's utilized for synchronizing the system's internal clock with the actual time, facilitating accurate schedule management and timing operations.

- **Milliseconds Per Minute (60000):** Defines the length of one minute in milliseconds. This setting is crucial for converting the system's time calculations into real-time operations, ensuring the timing functionalities like reminders are executed with precision.

### Reminder Settings

- **Initial Reminder Delay (2 seconds):** Specifies the delay before the first reminder beep is emitted after a scheduled reminder time is reached. This short interval allows for immediate notification with a brief pause to avoid startling the user.

- **Initial Times to Beep (5):** Indicates how many times the system will beep during the initial reminder. This feature is designed to attract the user's attention effectively, ensuring they are aware of the need to take their medication.

- **Milliseconds Between Beeps (85):** The duration between consecutive beeps in a reminder sequence. This timing is optimized to make the reminder audible and noticeable without being annoying, striking a balance between alertness and comfort for the user.

These settings are integral to the functionality of the Physical-Med-Reminder system, providing a reliable and user-friendly platform for medication management. Developers have the flexibility to modify these parameters according to specific requirements, enabling customization for varying reminder needs or operational preferences.
