{"Time":"1684869799","Type":"Response","Text":"Based on the information provided in the \"project ssot\", if Bob's alarm is set for 12:00 PM and he does not mark the pill as taken, the app will initiate a decaying back-off system where the reminders will become gradually louder but less frequent following the Fibonacci sequence. The reminders will continue until Bob marks the pill as taken or snoozes the reminder. If the pill is not marked as taken, the app will auto-snooze the reminder and continue with the decaying back-off system.","ParentMessageId":"b0b4f38d-7f3c-40d6-8201-beeeeb8ac280","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
