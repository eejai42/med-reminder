{"Time":"1684099934","Type":"Response","Text":"To publish your NuGet package publicly, you can follow these general steps:\n\n1. Create an account on a NuGet hosting service such as nuget.org.\n2. Build your library into a NuGet package using the `nuget pack` command or by creating a `.nupkg` file manually.\n3. Upload your package to the hosting service either through their web interface or using a command-line tool like `nuget push`.\n4. Once your package is uploaded and approved (if necessary), it will be available for other projects to reference via the package manager in their respective IDEs.\n\nEach hosting service may have specific requirements for uploading packages, so make sure to check their documentation for any additional steps or guidelines.","ParentMessageId":"8c6c7524-d7ce-4ba8-a053-a964cd866d1a","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
