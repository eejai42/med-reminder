{"Time":"1682788201","Type":"Prompt","Text":"I have some ideas.  Please add them to the project.\n1. I want to be able to set multiple alarms per day\n2. I want to have the alarm go off in a little bit of an unusual way - where when it is set it just goes \"beep\" - once - and then stops.  And then beeps again maybe 15 seconds later.  And then again 30 seconds later.  So a decaying back-off effectively.\n3. I want to be able to snooze all alarms at any point that will basically snooze all alarms for the next N minutes.  This way if I take my meds a little bit early, I can \"mark\" that I've taken them my snoozing the alarm.\nDo these rules make sense?  Can you add them to the project as an array of rules?","ParentMessageId":"","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
