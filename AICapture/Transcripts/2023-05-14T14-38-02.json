{"Time":"1684093099","Type":"Response","Text":"Assuming that Bob has set the reminders for noon and 9:00 PM, his experience using the app would be as follows:\n\n1. If he takes both pills on time:\n   - The app will send two reminders at the designated times (noon and 9:00 PM).\n   - When the reminders go off, he can mark the pills as taken from the reminder/notification screen.\n  \n2. If he misses one of the pills:\n   - The app will continue to send the reminder for the missed pill until he marks it as taken.\n   - If he doesn't mark it as taken, the app will auto-snooze the reminder according to the ringing rules until he does mark it as taken.\n  \n3. If he misses both pills:\n   - The app will continue to send the reminders for both pills until he marks them as taken.\n   - If he doesn't mark them as taken, the app will auto-snooze the reminders according to the ringing rules until he does mark them as taken. \n\nIn all cases, the app will use the decaying back-off system to adjust the frequency and intensity of the reminders based on whether or not the pills have been marked as taken.","ParentMessageId":"ee8917b0-ee4f-4fe6-852f-1e439a392467","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}

{"Time":"1684093177","Type":"Response","Text":"Sure, here's what would happen in different scenarios:\n\n1. If Bob takes the pill on time:\n   - The app will send him a reminder around noon and 9:00 pm.\n   - He can mark the pills as 'taken' from the reminder/notification screen, and the app will stop reminding him for that specific dose.\n\n2. If Bob forgets to take the pill:\n   - The app will send him a reminder at the scheduled time (noon or 9:00 pm) with a single quiet beep.\n   - If he does not mark the pill as 'taken' within 10 seconds, the app will auto-snooze and remind him again after some time.\n   - The subsequent reminders will be more urgent, with gradually increasing intensity and less frequent beeps following a Fibonacci sequence, until he marks the pill as taken or snoozes it manually.\n   - If the pill is still not marked as taken by the end of the day, the app will reset and remind him again the next day.\n\n3. If Bob takes the pill early:\n   - He can mark the pill as 'taken' from the reminder/notification screen as soon as he takes it.\n   - The app will not send any further reminders for that specific dose, even if the scheduled time has not yet arrived.\n   - If he accidentally marks the pill as taken too early, the app will still send the reminder at the scheduled time, and he can simply ignore it.","ParentMessageId":"0e1320b3-0c45-459f-80bb-818fcaf1892a","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
