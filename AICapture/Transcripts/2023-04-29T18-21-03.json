{"Time":"1682792462","Type":"Response","Text":"# med-alarm\n\nmed-alarm is a comprehensive medication reminder app for Android and iOS devices. The app has been designed to help users stay on top of their medications by providing multiple reminders per day that must be marked as taken. Here are the specific rules for the app:\n\n## Overall Rules\n- Users can set multiple reminders per day for different medicines or doses.\n- Each reminder must be marked as taken.\n- Unique decaying back-off system will increase urgency and decrease frequency of reminders over time.\n\n## Ringing Rules\n- Initial reminder will have a single quiet beep.\n- Subsequent reminders will have gradually louder beeps following Fibonacci sequence.\n\n## Mark As Taken Rules\n- If user marks pill intake earlier than expected, the next reminder will be skipped.\n\n### Use Case 1: Multiple Reminders\nIf a user needs to take medication at multiple times throughout the day, they can set multiple reminders in the app. The app will then send notifications at each scheduled time, reminding the user to take their medication. \n\n### Use Case 2: Decaying Back-off System\nAs the user takes their medication throughout the day, the app will adjust the frequency and urgency of the reminders based on a unique decaying back-off system. This ensures that the user will continue to receive timely reminders, without being overwhelmed with too many notifications.\n\n## Conclusion\nThe rules built into med-alarm allow users to easily manage their medications, ensuring that they never miss a dose. The app's multiple reminders, decaying back-off system, and marking as taken rules ensure that users stay on track with their medication schedule.","ParentMessageId":"6832ae70-358a-4372-b30e-a150b3a611dc","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
{"Time":"1682792761","Type":"Prompt","Text":"You're close - but it seems like the purpose of the decaying back-off system is still a little fuzzy to you.  Please suggest one additional \"ringing rule\" that would clarify this use cases with a newspaper headline style, concise description for the following use case:\nMy current alarm rings at noon for 30 seconds, shaking and beeping the whole time.  So if I happen to be in a different room the whole house has to deal with the ringing for 30 sceonds.  And then 5 MINUTES later (way too long) it rings again for another 30 seconds.  This app (by contrast) would just beep once - and then again 10 seconds later.  And then again 30 seconds later, maybe getting a little loud each time.  But the key is that the initial ring is just a gentle - \"it's time\" - where if I still haven't taken it 5 minutes later it might be appropriate for it to ring and shake for 30 sceonds straight.  BUt not the FIRST Time.  \nSo - clearly there are at least 1 or two rules that could be added where this specific use case is implied, right?","ParentMessageId":"","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
{"Time":"1682792760","Type":"Response","Text":"Project Name: med-alarm\n\nDescription:\nmed-alarm is a medication reminder application for Android and iOS that allows users to set multiple reminders per day, which must be marked as taken. The app has a unique decaying back-off system that increases the urgency and frequency of reminders as time passes. It provides single quiet beeps for initial reminders, followed by gradually louder but less frequent beeps using the Fibonacci sequence. Marking pill intake early skips the next reminder.\n\nOverall Rules:\n- Set multiple reminders per day, must be marked as taken.\n- Unique decaying back-off system, increasing urgency, decreasing frequency.\n\nRinging Rules:\n- Single quiet beep for initial reminder.\n- Gradually louder, but less frequent beeps following Fibonacci sequence.\n- Additional rule: \"Initial reminder beeps are gentle, with increasing intensity only after subsequent reminders.\"\n\nMark As Taken Rules:\n- Marking pill intake early skips next reminder.\n\nTwo Use Cases:\n\n1) Jane needs to take her medication three times a day. She sets reminders for 8 AM, 12 PM, and 6 PM using med-alarm. At 8 AM, she hears a single quiet beep, reminding her that it's time to take her medication. If she hasn't marked the medication as taken within ten minutes, she will hear another beep that is slightly louder than the first. This gradual increase in intensity continues every fifteen minutes until she marks the medication as taken. If she marks the medication as taken before the second beep, the app will skip the next scheduled reminder at 12 PM.\n\n2) Mike takes a medication that causes him to fall asleep quickly. He sets reminders for 10 PM, 10:15 PM, and 10:30 PM using med-alarm. The initial reminder at 10 PM is a single quiet beep, so it doesn't disturb his sleep. However, if he hasn't marked the medication as taken within five minutes, the app will remind him again with a slightly louder beep. The intensity of the beeps increases every ten minutes until he marks the medication as taken or until the third reminder at 10:30 PM.\n\nConclusion:\n\nmed-alarm is an effective app for managing medication reminders that allows users to customize their schedules and receive gentle reminders that gradually increase in intensity over time. With the unique decaying back-off system, users can receive reminders that are tailored to their needs without feeling overwhelmed by constant alerts.","ParentMessageId":"8311e6b7-a1db-4eb1-bdfa-7c0b80fd7b16","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
