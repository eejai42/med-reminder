{"Time":"1684095679","Type":"Response","Text":"Based on the \"med-reminder\" project SSOT, if someone doesn't take the pill and does not mark it as taken, the app will continue to send reminders following a unique decaying back-off system with increasing urgency and decreasing frequency. If the user still doesn't take the pill after a certain amount of time (which can be specified in the app settings), the reminder will stop.\n\nOn the other hand, if someone takes the pill early and marks it as taken, the app will skip the next scheduled reminder for that pill. However, if they accidentally marked the pill as taken early, there is an option to undo the action within the app.","ParentMessageId":"7273c131-0dda-4485-a545-8ded1d5be3c7","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}

{"Time":"1684098663","Type":"Response","Text":"Sure, here are some scenarios with specific details:\n\nScenario 1: User misses a pill reminder\n- At the scheduled time, the notification for the pill reminder will go off.\n- If the user does not mark the pill as taken within 10 seconds, the app will auto-snooze the reminder for 5 minutes.\n- After the first auto-snooze, the reminder will sound again with a single quiet beep.\n- If the user still does not mark the pill as taken, the app will continue to auto-snooze the reminder with increasing duration and decreasing frequency based on a unique decaying back-off system.\n- The reminders will continue until the user marks the pill as taken or manually dismisses the reminder.\n\nScenario 2: User takes a pill early\n- The user opens the medication reminder app before the scheduled time of the pill reminder.\n- They mark the pill as taken from the reminder/notification screen.\n- The reminder for that particular pill will be removed from the list of upcoming reminders.\n- If the user accidentally marks the pill as taken early, they can undo the action by tapping the \"undo\" button that appears after marking the pill as taken.\n\nI hope this helps clarify how the app handles missed and early pills.","ParentMessageId":"4877f084-7962-4ce9-a323-c1700aa8480e","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
