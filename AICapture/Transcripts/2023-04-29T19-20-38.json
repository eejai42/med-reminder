{"Time":"1682796037","Type":"Response","Text":"Here are three different scenarios that might unfold and how the med-reminder app would behave in each case:\n\n1. If the phone is within Bluetooth range of the user, the app may be able to detect the user's presence and trigger the initial reminder with a single quiet beep. If the user does not mark the pill as \"taken\" within 10 seconds, the app will auto-snooze and repeat the reminder with a slightly more urgent tone after a short while. The app will continue to remind the user with gradually louder, but less frequent beeps following a Fibonacci sequence until the pill is marked as \"taken\" or until the maximum number of reminders has been reached.\n\n2. If the phone is out of Bluetooth range, the app will not be able to detect the user's presence and trigger the initial reminder. In this scenario, the user will not receive any reminders until they return within range of their phone. Once they do, the app will trigger the initial reminder with a single quiet beep and follow the same behavior pattern as described in scenario 1.\n\n3. If the user has turned off their phone or if the battery has died, the app will not be able to trigger any reminders. In this scenario, the user will not receive any reminders until they turn on their phone or charge the battery. Once they do, the app will trigger the initial reminder with a single quiet beep and follow the same behavior pattern as described in scenario 1.","ParentMessageId":"9cb120a8-e6e7-4cbe-a46a-ff2d4a48a3e9","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
{"Time":"1682796172","Type":"Prompt","Text":"This scenario has nothing to do with bluetooth.  The user can hear/see both the phone and the pill box - but they would have to stop stir-frying the beans they're in the middle of cooking to do so.. so they'd  rather not.  Let's assume that all together, dinner could take up to 5 minutes to prepare - but would not necessarily require the user's full attention that whole time.  So the 3 scenarios are mostly based on how quickly the user gets away from the cooking, and back to the phone/pills to take the pills and mark them as taken on the phone.","ParentMessageId":"","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
{"Time":"1682796171","Type":"Response","Text":"Here are three scenarios and how the app would behave in each case:\n\n1. Scenario 1: The user hears the initial reminder beep while cooking, but does not have time to attend to the pill at that moment. The app's auto-snooze feature will activate and remind the user again after a set period of time, with a gradually increasing intensity of reminders until the user confirms that they have taken the medication.\n\n2. Scenario 2: The user does not hear the initial beep while cooking, and misses the first reminder. The app will continue to send reminders at decaying intervals, increasing in urgency and decreasing in frequency, until the user confirms that they have taken the medication. If the user still does not confirm taking the medication, the app will mark the pill as skipped.\n\n3. Scenario 3: The user is able to attend to the phone when the initial reminder sounds, but forgets to mark the pill as taken on the app. In this case, the app will auto-snooze and repeat the reminder at decaying intervals, increasing in urgency and decreasing in frequency, until the user confirms that they have taken the medication or marks it as skipped. The app's marking system ensures that the user cannot cheat by marking the pills as taken before actually ingesting them.","ParentMessageId":"843bce22-3402-4f5f-8cc4-d422131cf604","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
{"Time":"1682796389","Type":"Prompt","Text":"You have somehow interpreted the rules to handle a scenario where a user can't \"cheat\" by marking pills as take before actually ingeting them.  This COMPLETELY misunderstands the rule about this rule. \"reminder skipped even if pill intake marked early\".\nPlease rewrite this rule to instead indicate that ... if the user takes the pill early (and marks that they have done so) that the associated reminder will not be activated because the pill has laready been marked as taken.  It isn't about cheating.  It's about not overly reminding them to take a pill that they already took (for example) 10 minutes before the reminder was set to go off.","ParentMessageId":"","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
{"Time":"1682796388","Type":"Response","Text":"Apologies for the misunderstanding.
