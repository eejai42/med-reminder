{"Time":"1682788370","Type":"Response","Text":"# med-alarm\n\nmed-alarm is a mobile application for Android and iOS that helps users remember to take their medication in a specific way. It allows users to set multiple alarms per day, implement a decaying back-off alarm system, and includes a snooze feature to snooze all alarms at once.\n\n## Rules\n- Allow setting multiple alarms per day: Users can set several reminders throughout the day to take their medication.\n- Implement a decaying back-off alarm system: If the user misses an alarm, the app will send another reminder after a certain amount of time has passed. The time between alarms will increase each time until the user acknowledges the notification.\n- Include a snooze feature to snooze all alarms at once: Users can temporarily silence all alarms with one tap of the snooze button.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n1. Alice needs to take her medication four times a day, so she sets four alarms using med-alarm. The first two days go smoothly, but on the third day, she misses one alarm because she's busy with work. The app sends a new notification 30 minutes later to remind her to take her medication. Since she still hasn't acknowledged the notification, the app sends another notification an hour later instead of the default 30 minutes. This continues until Alice finally acknowledges the notification.\n2. Bob usually takes his medication as soon as he wakes up, but sometimes he snoozes his alarm and falls back asleep. To avoid this, he sets two alarms using med-alarm - one for when he initially wakes up and another as a backup. If he misses the first alarm, the app will send a notification 10 minutes later. If he misses that one too, the app sends another notification 20 minutes later.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nThe rules implemented in med-alarm allow users to customize their medication reminders to fit their specific needs. The ability to set multiple alarms per day, decaying back-off alarm system, and snooze feature offer flexibility and reliability in medication management.","ParentMessageId":"708b7859-76e9-4445-9e32-7ba9e6ebb245","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
{"Time":"1682788794","Type":"Prompt","Text":"So - these use cases are not correct - please create a new list of rules that better encapsulate this behavior.  Here's how my current reminder works.  I'm bob - I have to take meds twice a day - so I set 1 alarm at noon and the other at 9:00 PM.  Then - if I'm in the kitchen when the noon alarm goes off in the other room, it goes off for a full 30 seconds, beeping loudly and shaking the whole time.  Everyone in the house knows that the alarm has gone off.  \nThis is overkill - I just need 1 short beep - and then I know I need to take them when I go back into the room where the pill box is.  \nIf within say 30 seconds later I have gone and marked the pills as \"taken\" - then it will go off again.  Maybe beeping twice.\nThen at 1 minute it could beep 3 times and shake for half a second.  In other words - it will, at decreasing intervals, but with increasing \"urgency\" try to get my attention.\nSo - let's call these the ringingRules.\nThe other thing that happens it that I will wake up a little bit early, and take my pill at 11. (or 12:59) - but either way - I have to sit and wait for the alarm to go off before I can \"mark the pills as taken\".  \nBut I'd like to be able to basically mark them as taken BEFORE the actual alarm goes off - basically - like a skip next alarm function maybe.  Idk.  Let's start with this -do you understand the rules?\nIf so - please make a newspaper headline style list of ringingRules and snoozingRules for the project that encapsulate these.","ParentMessageId":"","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
{"Time":"1682788794","Type":"Response","Text":"Sure, based on your explanation, here are some revised rules for the med-alarm project:\n\nringingRules:\n- Allow users to set multiple alarms per day for medication reminders.\n- Implement a decaying back-off alarm system that starts with a short beep and gradually increases in intensity and frequency if pills are not marked as taken.\n- The first alarm will beep once for a short duration of time, and subsequent alarms will increase in intensity and frequency until pills are marked as taken.\n\nsnoozingRules:\n- Include a snooze feature to allow users to delay all alarms at once.\n- If users mark their medication as \"taken\" before the actual alarm goes off, they can skip the next scheduled alarm.\n\nExample use case 1:\nBob sets two alarms for his medication reminders - one at noon and one at 9 pm. When the noon alarm goes off, it beeps once for a short duration. Bob is in another room but knows he needs to take his pills when he returns to the kitchen. He marks his pills as taken within 30 seconds, so the alarm does not escalate in intensity or frequency. When the 9 pm alarm goes off, Bob is in the same room as his pillbox and takes his medication immediately. He marks his pills as taken before the alarm goes off, so the next scheduled alarm is skipped.\n\nExample use case 2:\nSamantha sets three alarms for her medication reminders - one at 8 am, one at 1 pm, and one at 6 pm. When the 8 am alarm goes off, she is in the middle of a meeting and cannot take her pills right away. Instead, she snoozes the alarm for 15 minutes. When the alarm goes off again, she marks her pills as \"taken\" even though it's earlier than the scheduled time. The app skips the next scheduled alarm and sets a new one for 1 pm. When the 1 pm alarm goes off, Samantha is in the middle of a workout and cannot take her pills right away. She marks her pills as \"taken\" within 30 seconds, so the alarm does not escalate in intensity or frequency. When the 6 pm alarm goes off, Samantha is cooking dinner and misses the first beep. The app starts to increase the intensity and frequency of the alarm until she marks her pills as taken after the third beep.","ParentMessageId":"a5b6130d-e60d-4a93-8231-f90c500bd6a8","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}

When the initial alarm goes off, it starts with a single beep. If the user hasn't marked their pills as taken within 30 seconds, the alarm will beep twice.

They also have the ability to mark their pills as taken before the scheduled alarm goes off using the app's 'mark as taken' button. These features provide users with greater flexibility and control over their medication routine, making it easier to stay on track and avoid missed doses.","ParentMessageId":"c9c8d29f-0f61-4477-9448-f2943d30832e","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}

{"Time":"1682789157","Type":"Response","Text":"Sure, here's the updated list of rules for the med-alarm app:\n\n{\n  \"project\": {\n    \"name\": \"med-alarm\",\n    \"description\": \"An app for Android and iOS that reminds users to take their medication in a specific way.\",\n    \"filename\": \"\\\\ssot\\\\single-source-of-truth.json\",\n    \"ringingRules\": [\n      \"Initial reminder is a short beep instead of a full alarm\",\n      \"Re-notify if pills are not marked as taken within 30 seconds with an increasing number of beeps\",\n      \"Increase urgency of reminders at 1-minute intervals using incremental back-off on ringing\"\n    ],\n    \"snoozingRules\": [\n      \"Users can mark pills as 'taken' before scheduled alarm using 'skip next alarm' function\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n\nHere's how these features work:\n\n- When it's time to take medication, the med-alarm app sends an initial reminder with a short beep.\n- If the user does not mark the pills as 'taken' within 30 seconds, the app will re-notify them with an increasing number of beeps until they acknowledge the reminder. This helps ensure that users don't miss taking their medication.\n- The app also increases the urgency of reminders at 1-minute intervals by using incremental back-off on ringing. This means that the alarm will start with a single beep and add additional beeps with each passing decay cycle, gradually gaining the attention of the user without being overwhelming.\n- Users can mark pills as 'taken' before the scheduled alarm using the 'skip next alarm' function. This allows them to take their medication whenever they want without having to wait for the scheduled alarm.\n\nUse Case 1: \nBob uses the med-alarm app to remind him to take his medication twice a day. At noon, the app sends an initial reminder with a short beep. Bob is in the kitchen at the time, so he doesn't hear it. However, 30 seconds later, the app re-notifies him with two beeps that gradually increase in urgency until he acknowledges the reminder. Bob marks his pills as 'taken' using the 'skip next alarm' function since he's already taken them earlier.\n\nUse Case 2: \nJane is a forgetful person and often misses taking her medication on time. She sets the med-alarm app to remind her every three hours. The app sends an initial reminder with a short beep, which Jane hears and acknowledges. After three hours, the app re-notifies her with four beeps that increase in urgency until she acknowledges the reminder. This process repeats itself every time Jane forgets to take her medication on time. Thanks to the incremental back-off on ringing, Jane can gradually get used to the reminders without feeling overwhelmed.","ParentMessageId":"90832612-4e2f-4356-8a16-fed2dd492341","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
