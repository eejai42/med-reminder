{"Time":"1684101384","Type":"Response","Text":"The NuGet Package Manager Console is a built-in feature of Visual Studio that allows you to interact with NuGet and manage packages directly from within the IDE. However, if you are having trouble running NuGet commands in the Package Manager Console, it's possible that the NuGet command-line tool is not installed on your system. You can download the latest version of the NuGet command-line tool from the official NuGet website (https://www.nuget.org/downloads).\n\nAs for the many extensions available, they are developed by third-party developers and offer additional functionality beyond what is included in the built-in NuGet Package Manager Console. It's always important to review the publisher and user reviews when selecting an extension to ensure it is trustworthy.","ParentMessageId":"40a13009-062a-4b04-a67e-4565871400aa","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
