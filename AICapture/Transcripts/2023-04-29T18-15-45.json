A user needs to take a medication thrice a day - morning, afternoon and night. The user sets three reminders for each day at specific times. The app reminds them with a quiet beep initially, then gradually louder and more frequent beeps until they mark the medication as taken.\n2. A user takes certain medications only on specific days of the week. The user customizes their medication schedule using the flexible pill scheduling options, so the app reminds them only on those days.\n\nConclusion:\nThe above-listed rules allow users to manage their medication schedules effectively by providing multiple reminders, flexible scheduling options, and customized reminder intervals.
