Latest NuGet releases are delivered as part of Visual Studio updates.Note: nuget.exe itself is not included with any version of Visual Studio.\nDo either of these let me publish a nuget package?  Or just install them in my project?  How can this be so difficult!!!  Last time, it felt like I right click published and I was done.  I didn't need to be downloading extra tools and adding yet ANOTHER THING To my gd path!!!!!   There are like 1000 characters available in a windows path, why on earth do I need to add ANOTHER FUCKING TOOL there just to upload these dll's.  This CAN'T be this fucking hard!!!!","ParentMessageId":"","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
{"Time":"1684101570","Type":"Response","Text":"I understand that you are frustrated, but let's try to approach this calmly. \n\nTo publish a NuGet package, you need to have the `nuget.exe` command-line tool installed on your machine or use the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio.\n\nIf you choose to use the `nuget.exe` command-line tool, you can download it from the official NuGet website, and then run the `nuget push` command followed by the path to your `.nupkg` file. \n\nIf you prefer to use the NuGet Package Manager in Visual Studio, you can right-click on your project, select \"Manage NuGet Packages,\" navigate to the \"Package Manager\" tab, and click on the \"Publish\" button to upload your package.\n\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns.","ParentMessageId":"087b7b44-846e-4c9a-885a-d4eaee01126f","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
