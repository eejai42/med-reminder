{"Time":"1684101117","Type":"Response","Text":"The NuGet package manager console is used to manage NuGet packages in your Visual Studio project. If you are receiving an error that \"nuget\" is not recognized, it may be because the NuGet executable is not added to your system's PATH environment variable. You can download the latest version of NuGet.exe from https://www.nuget.org/downloads and add it to your PATH.\n\nAlternatively, you can install the NuGet Package Manager extension for Visual Studio, which will allow you to manage NuGet packages directly within the IDE. To install the extension, go to Tools > Extensions and Updates, search for \"NuGet Package Manager\", and click \"Install\".","ParentMessageId":"e5b7bfef-7fea-4201-915a-8f8af7732b22","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
