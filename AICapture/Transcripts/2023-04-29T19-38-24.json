{"Time":"1682797206","Type":"Response","Text":"Sure, here's an example readme.md for the \"med-reminder\" app:\n\n# med-reminder\n\nThe `med-reminder` app is a comprehensive medication reminder app available for both Android and iOS devices. It allows users to set multiple reminders per day and mark pills as taken directly from the reminder/notification screen. The app features a unique decaying back-off system that increases urgency and decreases frequency over time.\n\n## Features\n\n### Overall Rules\n\n- Set multiple reminders per day, must be marked as taken\n- Unique decaying back-off system, increasing urgency, decreasing frequency\n\n### Ringing Rules\n\n- Single quiet beep for initial reminder, auto-snooze for 10 seconds\n- Initial reminder gentle, with increasing intensity after subsequent auto-snoozes.\n- Gradually louder, but less frequent beeps following Fibonacci sequence\n- Reminders not marked as 'taken' are automatically snoozed\n\n### Marking as Taken Rules\n\n- Reminder skipped if pill intake marked early\n\n## Example\n\nSuppose a user sets a reminder for a medication they need to take three times a day at 8 AM, 12 PM, and 5 PM. At 8 AM, the app will send a single quiet beep notification reminding the user to take their medication. If the user doesn't mark the reminder as taken within 10 seconds, the app will snooze the notification and send another reminder 10 minutes later with a slightly more intense sound. \n\nIf the user still hasn't marked the reminder as taken, subsequent notifications will occur with gradually louder, but less frequent beeps following the Fibonacci sequence (1 minute, 2 minutes, 3 minutes, 5 minutes, 8 minutes, etc.). If the user marks the medication as taken during any of these notifications, the app will stop sending additional notifications for that particular reminder. However, if the user marks the medication as taken earlier than the scheduled reminder, the app will skip the remaining notifications for that time slot.\n\n## Filename\n\nThe file containing the specifications for this app is named `single-source-of-truth.json` and can be found in the root directory. \n\n## Installation\n\nTo install the `med-reminder` app, simply download it from the App Store or Google Play Store on your iOS or Android device respectively.","ParentMessageId":"5d9fed57-a670-49d1-a1ce-9d93d3947eff","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
