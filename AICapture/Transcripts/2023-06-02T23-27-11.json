{"Time":"1685766440","Type":"Response","Text":"The ringing rules for the \"med-reminder\" app project are:\n\n1. A single quiet beep for the initial reminder with an auto-snooze feature for 10 seconds.\n2. The subsequent reminders will start off gentle, with increasing intensity after each subsequent auto-snooze.\n3. The beeps will gradually get louder but less frequent, following the Fibonacci sequence.\n4. Reminders that are not marked as \"taken\" will be auto-snoozed.","ParentMessageId":"59f03bec-845c-4e69-a9e5-59e444240d48","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}

However, if he accidentally marks a pill as taken, there is an option to undo it.","ParentMessageId":"80fa9df0-fefb-4a95-9fff-001ab2ff4760","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}

{"Time":"1685766567","Type":"Response","Text":"The rules for ringing include a single quiet beep for the initial reminder with an auto-snooze for 10 seconds. The initial reminder is gentle, and the intensity increases after subsequent auto-snoozes. The beeps gradually become louder but less frequent following the Fibonacci sequence. Reminders that are not marked as \"taken\" are auto-snoozed.\n\nIf Bob forgets a pill, he can take the missed dose as soon as he remembers it unless it's too close to his next scheduled dose. In such a case, he should skip the missed dose and continue with his regular dosing schedule. However, it's always best to consult with a healthcare professional if he has any questions or concerns regarding medication.\n\nIf reminders for a dose are not marked as taken, the app will auto-snooze the reminder, and it will re-notify Bob after a set period according to the decaying back-off system mentioned in the overall rules. For example, if Bob was supposed to take a pill at 2:00 PM but didn't mark it as taken, the app would auto-snooze the reminder and remind him again after a specified time with increased urgency and decreased frequency.","ParentMessageId":"9cf389f8-bebb-4f26-80a0-8603d68483e1","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}

{"Time":"1685766648","Type":"Response","Text":"The rules for ringing are: \n- A single quiet beep for the initial reminder with an auto-snooze for 10 seconds.\n- The initial reminder is gentle, and the intensity increases after subsequent auto-snoozes.\n- Reminders become gradually louder but less frequent using the Fibonacci sequence.\n- Reminders not marked as 'taken' are auto-snoozed.\n\nIf Bob forgets a pill, he will miss that dose. It is up to him to decide whether to take the next scheduled dose or follow the instructions from his healthcare provider regarding missed doses.\n\nIf reminders for a dose are not marked as taken, the app will continue to remind the user based on the ringing rules. For example, if Bob is meant to take a pill at 2:00 PM and does not mark it as taken, the app will continue to remind him with increasing urgency and decreasing frequency until he either takes the pill or manually dismisses the reminder.\n\nWhen Bob doesn't take his pill, \"increased urgency and decreased frequency\" means that the app will remind him more frequently, with more noticeable and urgent tones, until he marks the dose as taken.","ParentMessageId":"3d7d38be-afe9-48b6-a546-8adedba62b42","ConversationId":"","IsHidden":"False"}
